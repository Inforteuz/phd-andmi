PhD Independent Researchers Reporting Platform

This platform is designed specifically for PhD independent researchers to submit their progress reports. The platform includes a calendar feature where admins can schedule upcoming meetings or conferences, which will then be visible to all users. Additionally, there is a chat section for communication between users.

Features:
Admin Panel:

Admins can manage upcoming events and set visible deadlines and meetings on the calendar for all users.
Admins also have control over the "Delete" functionality for uploaded documents, ensuring approval before deletion.
Portfolio Section:

This section includes six key areas for researchers to upload and manage their work:
Mundarija: Researchers can upload their work related to the table of contents (Mundarija), with past submissions displayed in a tabular format (including columns for Name, Number, Title, and any additional comments).
Activities: Similar to the Mundarija section, with data being sent to the admin panel and available for download in Excel format.
Articles: A section for researchers to upload and manage their published articles, displayed in a table format.
Patents and Inventions: Researchers can submit their patents and inventions in this section, also displayed in a table format.
Textbooks: A section dedicated to uploading textbooks.
Languages: This section helps researchers track language-related work.
Dissertation Progress: A section where researchers can upload and track their dissertation progress.

This platform aims to streamline the research reporting process, ensuring transparency and easy access for both researchers and administrators.
